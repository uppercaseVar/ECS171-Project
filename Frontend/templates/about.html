            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project aims to enhance the utilization of residential solar power systems by predicting solar energy output using machine learning techniques. Accurate solar energy forecasting allows homeowners to optimize the timing of energy-intensive tasks, such as laundry, to coincide with peak solar generation, maximizing the use of their solar energy and reducing utility costs.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Many homeowners with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems sell excess energy back to the grid at lower rates due to the absence of battery storage solutions. Predicting solar energy production can help in better planning energy use, thereby increasing savings and reducing reliance on the grid.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The main goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately forecast solar energy production. These predictions can help homeowners align their energy consumption with solar generation, enhancing cost savings and promoting efficient use of renewable energy.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>The dataset used in this project was collected from a residential solar power system in Cupertino, California, over two years. Data includes various parameters such as time, cloud cover, dew point, humidity, precipitation, solar energy received, solar radiation, sun elevation, temperature, UV index, and power generated by the solar panels.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
            <p>Data quality was ensured by removing rows affected by database outages and unrealistic outliers. Timestamps were converted to the local hour of the day for better analysis. Various normalization techniques were prepared, including StandardScaler, Z-Score Normalization, and Min-Max Normalization.</p>

            <h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
            <p>The project explored different models including linear regression, polynomial regression, and deep neural networks (DNNs). k-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate model performance, with a focus on minimizing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).</p>

        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <h3>Model Performance</h3>
            <p>Polynomial regression with a degree of 7 and Z-Score normalization performed well, achieving an MAE of 114. However, the deep neural network (DNN) model, particularly with a tiny model structure and no normalization, yielded the best results with an MAE of 112. The DNN model demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness in predicting solar energy output.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The study shows that advanced machine learning techniques can significantly improve the accuracy of solar energy output predictions. Homeowners can use these predictions to optimize their energy consumption, leading to increased savings and more efficient use of their solar power systems.</p>

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>Further improvements can be made by incorporating additional features or using more sophisticated models. Expanding the dataset to include different geographic locations and weather conditions can enhance the modelâ€™s generalizability.</p>
